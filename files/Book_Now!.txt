Edinburgh’s Aerial and Acrobatic Convention is in its ninth year of introducing arts such as trapeze, acrobalance, tumbling and aerial hoop to the Scottish public. The EAAC is the UK’s largest event of its kind and brings together individuals and groups from all over the country wishing to expand their existing practice through a wide range of workshops teaching new skills and arts.This year’s EAAC aims to further promote aerial and acrobatic arts and include a focus on teaching standards and safe practice. Many of this year’s workshops will be led by world class performers and teachers who will be passing on their skills and techniques in this 3 day convention and will be including a number of new disciplines never taught here before.The EAAC takes place from the 4th - 6th of September at St Leonards Land, Edinburgh.  The event opens at 12 on Friday and we are open from 9-5 on both Saturday and Sunday, with the end of convention show taking place at CSE The Pleasance, Edinburgh.
